cec-simplest - Simple app to control the play and pause of Chromecast using a keyboard attached to a raspberry pi. The app is meant to be on all the time, it stays idle until a key is pressed. I'm using this because my LG 42LE5300 although it supports CEC, it does not send the pause and play keypresses from the remote to the Chromecast.
